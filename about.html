                <h1 class="background-head">BACKGROUND</h1>
                <p class="background-story">I am currently a high school student in my
                    senior year in Mumbai, India, pursuing A Levels with subjects in Mathematics, Physics, 
                    Computer Science, Further Mathematics, and English Literature.
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up, I have been mainly passionate about two things: learning 
                    about technology and playing table tennis. My fascination with 
                    technology has led me to develop a keen interest 
                    in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. I am always in awe when 
                    discovering the unknown, and I enjoy diving deep into new concepts,
                    constantly visualizing how they work and interconnect.
                    <br><br>
                    Playing table tennis has taught me valuable life skills, such
                    as patience and improved hand-eye coordination. These lessons have not only 
                    made me a better player but have also helped me in my academic pursuits, particularly
                    in problem-solving and maintaining focus. 
                    <br><br>
                    Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue
                    a degree in computer science at university, where I can
                    further explore my interests in technology and continue to develop my skills.
